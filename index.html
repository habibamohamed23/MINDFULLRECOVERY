                                    Symptoms of a panic attack include extreme anxiety and physical sensations of fear, such as increased heart rate, shortness of breath, trembling and muscle tension.
                                    Triggers for panic attacks can include overbreathing, long periods of stress, activities that lead to intense physical reactions 
                                    (for example exercise, excessive coffee drinking) and physical changes occurring after illness or a sudden change of environment.
                                    Panic attacks can be treated with a range of therapies including medications, psychotherapy and stress management and relaxation techniques.

                                War can lead to prolonged periods of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed. This can develop into clinical depression, affecting daily life and overall well-being.

                                Anxiety disorders, affecting over 30% of adults, differ from regular worries by causing excessive fear or worry that disrupts daily life. They intensify normal anxiety responses, leading to muscle tension and avoidance behaviors. Diagnosing an anxiety disorder disproportionately involves fear or worry, impeding normal functioning. Fortunately, effective psychotherapeutic treatments exist, offering hope for managing these conditions and reclaiming control over life.
